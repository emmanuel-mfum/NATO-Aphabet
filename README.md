# NATO-Aphabet
Small python program exercise in order to practice dictionary comprehension and data frames reading.
The program reads a .csv file and uses the data inside to make a dictionary where the keys are the letters of the alphabet and the 
definitions are those of the NATO alphabet.

The user can then input a word and the program will find the corresponding NATO code words to each of the letters of that word
